# Real-time Multiplayer Chess Game

## Project Overview

This project is a robust, real-time multiplayer chess game developed using a modern Node.js stack. It showcases a strong understanding of real-time communication, game logic implementation, and responsive web development. Designed with scalability and user experience in mind, this application provides a seamless and interactive chess playing experience, emphasizing clean architecture and adherence to best practices.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Gameplay:** Experience instant updates and fluid interactions powered by **Socket.IO**, ensuring a dynamic and engaging multiplayer environment.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Supports classic 1v1 chess matches, allowing players to compete as White or Black.
- **Spectator Mode:** Users can join ongoing games as spectators, observing the match in real-time without interference.
- **Robust Move Validation:** Integrates the powerful **Chess.js** library for comprehensive and accurate validation of all chess moves, adhering strictly to FIDE rules.
- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop Interface:** A user-friendly interface built with pure JavaScript, enabling effortless piece movement and enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with **Tailwind CSS**, the application offers a clean, modern, and adaptive interface across various devices.

### Backend

- **Node.js:** Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, ideal for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for routing and serving static assets.
- **Socket.IO:** A highly performant library enabling real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
- **Chess.js:** A comprehensive JavaScript chess library for chess move generation, validation, and board state management.

### Frontend

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** A simple templating language used for rendering dynamic HTML content on the server-side.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs with direct control over styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers the client-side interactivity, including drag-and-drop functionality and real-time board updates.
- **Socket.IO (Client-side):** Facilitates real-time communication with the backend for game state synchronization.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure Node.js (LTS version recommended) is installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **pnpm:** This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it, install it globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess.com.git
    cd chess.com
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` file:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    ```

    You can change the `PORT` value to any available port you prefer.

4.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

The application will now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you specified in your `.env` file).

## Deployment Strategy

This project is configured for straightforward deployment on cloud platforms like **Render**.

### Render Deployment

To deploy on Render, ensure your service is configured with the following build and start commands:

- **Build Command:** `pnpm install`
- **Start Command:** `pnpm start`

Render will automatically detect the Node.js environment and deploy your application.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user authentication and persistent game states.
- Introduce a matchmaking system and multiple game rooms.
- Add an in-game chat feature.
- Develop an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Integrate a database for storing game history and user profiles.
